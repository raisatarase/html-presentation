    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there!</p>
    <p>I'm Raisa a 30-year-old Romanian living in, you guessed it, Romania! 😄 <br> I love languages and can speak English, German, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Multilingual life, yay! 🥳</p>
    <p>I'm super excited about technology, and I've been actively studying IT at Titu Maiorescu University in Bucharest. <br> It's been an incredible journey so far, and I can't wait to see what the future holds!</p>
    <p>When I'm not geeking out with code, I'm all about crafts, sports, and travel. Exploring new places and cultures keeps me inspired and happy!</p>
    <p>Thanks for dropping by and getting to know a bit about me. Catch you later!</p> <br>
